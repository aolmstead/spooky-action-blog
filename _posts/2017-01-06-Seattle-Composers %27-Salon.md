The [Seattle Composers' Salon](http://composersalon.blogspot.com/2017/01/january-2017-salon-previews.html) is a monthly series at The Chapel Performance Space which showcases works-in-progress. We're excited for a chance to perform and collect comments and complaints from the audience. Bring your rotton fruits and vegetables for throwing! P.S. Organizer and maestro John Teske is a local arts super hero.
