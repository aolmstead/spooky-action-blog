### ...with the legendary Sun Ra Arkestra.

It's an honor to be sharing the stage with the venerable Sun Ra Arkestra. When I was 19, and already familiar with Sun Ra's solo piano work, I heard a recording of the Arkestra for the first time. It would take repeated listening for the radical social message of the music to sink in, but one moment made a lasting impression right away. A few minutes in, there was a sound so enormous and clear, I was immobilized. A sound not of Earth, it was everything at once. It came from [Marshall Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IGKBgV9ReI), who at 94 years old, will be leading the Arkestra on Friday and holding me captive once again. _- Andrew_
