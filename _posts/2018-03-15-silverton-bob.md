title: Silverton Bob the Wonder Collie!
---

If you thought the critters from _Homeward Bound_ were cool for walking <15 miles, then check out [Silverton Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_the_Wonder_Dog). The famed pooch legendarily traveled from Indiana to Silverton, Oregon in search of his idiot master, who had left Bob in the midwest while on vacation. "Bobbie the Wonder Collie" became a national sensation when his return was printed in papers, resulting in a lot of fan mail. This live comic sets three poems from such letters to music and art.
