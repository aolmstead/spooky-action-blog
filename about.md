Bob Ross meets Fantasia in this live drawing musical experience where comics artist [Elk Paauw](http://elkpapa.party) and composer [Andrew Olmstead](http://andrewolmstead.com) combine mediums to tell stories. Projecting Elk's drawings onto the nearest wall as they are made, all sound and art is produced by hand in real time. Each performance is a unique blend of audio-visual portraits, poem settings, folklore, PSAs, and original theatrical illustrations.

Currently based in Chicago, Elk and Andrew met in 2015 at the [Racer Sessions](http://www.racersessions.com/), a Seattle ommunity centered on improvised media. I you want, get in touch at [spookyactionart@gmail.com](mailto:spookyactionart@gmail.com)... xoxo : )
